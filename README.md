This project creates an interactive "digital rain" animation, similar to the effect in The Matrix, using an HTML .

Instead of letters and numbers, it features falling skull and bone emojis ('💀', '🦴', '☠️') that move down the screen. The animation is interactive; when you move your mouse cursor over the symbols, they highlight with a bright white glow. A fading trail effect is achieved by drawing a semi-transparent black background on each frame.
